store as an image

2 pixels correspond to one object

later on possibly store in one image, where each 2px by 2px  square is one object

bytearray

map:



[4 bytes, 1 byte, 1 byte padding]
[tileid, cleared, padding]

index of (O)bject  = 5 bytes * object number (len = 6 bytes)

eventmap:

[4 bytes, 1 byte,    , 1 byte]
[id     , tile number, unlocked]


for 2x2 square

x,y = ( 2 pixels) * object number + 1

x through x + 1 pixel
y through y + 1 pixel

append hex rgb values for each row to get entries (load as hex string)

split that hex value into individual objects
